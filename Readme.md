# SNPs Composition of Gene Tool(SCGtool)

The first descriptor characterizes the genome. It counters the single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) of genes from ariant Call Format (VCF) file based on General Feature Format(GFF3) (as shown the followed figure).

## Introdcution
SNP variants may result in the functional change of a gene. As the SNP number of a gene increases, the change rate of the gene function is higher. Based on the concept of conserved Sequence, we believe that the number of mutations on a gene can also be used as a feature. Therefore, we intend to develope a descriptor calculated the number of SNPs per gene. To achieve the descritptor, we need to know the SNPs and which genes they're on. The VCF specifies the format of a text file storing gene sequence variations. But it doesn't record the does not record which gene the SNPs belong to. The following two files contain the owning information of SNPS:
1. Annotated VCF file;
2. GFF3 File; 
If some genes of some population or individuals haven’t any SNPs, then the first approach would generate inconsistent feature space on different samples. The second file is used for describing genes and other features of DNA, RNA and protein sequences. Therefore, we developed the descriptor, named SCGtool, counted the variations of VCF file based on the genes information in GFF3 to characterize the genome (as shown ).The physical location of genes on chromosomes is ordered. The features generated by SCGtool can be viewed as time series.The SCGtool is defined as follows：

$$F=Vector\left(G_1,G_2\ldots G_n\right)$$
$$G_i=Count\left(SNP_{i_0},SNP_{i_1}\ldots S N P_{i_N}\right)$$

where $G_i$ represents the SNPs frequency ($Count\left(SNP_{i_0},SNP_{i_1}\ldots S N P_{i_N}\right)$) of $Gene_i$, $F$ include SNPs frequency of all genes ($G_1,G_2\ldots G_n$) on the genome. Whose features were temporary called SNPs time-series.

## Usage
This script takes as input a VCF file and a GFF3 File. **The format and sort of chrome of GFF3 must consistent with VCF file.**
